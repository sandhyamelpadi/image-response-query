                <p>This 6,300-square-foot home in Jensen Beach, Fla., is truly a sight
                     to behold, with the Atlantic Ocean on one side and a river on the 
                     other. When they're not hanging out on the covered patio or 
                      turtle and green sea turtle.Efforts are made to protect both species of sea turtles since nests have been
                       declining in recent years due to the severe erosion of the beach.
